# DAY6 Music Analysis With Spotify
This is a small project that I did to combine practicing my data visualization and machine learning skills with my favorite band, DAY6. DAY6 is a Korean band under JYP Entertainment that has released over 80 songs across multiple albums and EPs. I extracted data from Spotify's Web API using Spotipy to get musical characteristics of the original version of every song they have released, and made some data visualizations as well as performed K-Means Clustering on the data.
